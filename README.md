# Portfolio
Collection of my previous coding work
Portfolio projects

**1. Cycling** - analysis of CSV data for cycling: Throughout this project i analyised mutliple data sets combinding them to display different relationships and analysis them. i found the analysis for this data extreamly intresting, it combined many datasets and defenitly taught me alot about combinding dataframes. i found completing the graphs and analysising their output informative and showed that you cant make assumptions about a relationship between variables as often what i thought would be the outcome was in accurate. while i had minimal issues with the coding of this assignment as i was able to find a significant proportion of nessesary code in previous practicals, that could be adjusted for these data sets. i did have an issue commiting my work, showing me i need to educate myself in how this works and the solutions to the errors that often occur. i would also like to develope my analysis skills as to be able to extract as much information from outputs and my ability to clean data to ensure acurate data sets.

**2. Energy use** -  Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house: this project focused on recreating a snipit of an academic artical on the energy use of appliances, recreating plots and a liner regression model. i found the creation of many of the plots very interesting and interpreting the reults of the linear regression very intreaging. i learnt alot about manipulating plots through re creating the plots. however this project showed that i need to expand my knowledge in plot mainpulation and i have since researched different ways plots can be adjusted.

**3. Predictive models** - Predicting  the Genre of Books from Summaries: through this project i utilised different prediction models to predict a genre of a book based on the summary. i found this project enlightening as it taught me alot about the models and how they can be used to predict values. i would really like to expand my knowledge on different models so i would be able to utilise a wide variety of models for different projects.

**4. Covid - 19 effect on travel** - exploration into covid 19 & public transport & car usage: working with a team, i lead an exploration into the link between covid-19, public transport usage & road fines issued. throught his project i explored my leadership skills while applying knowledge previously developed. i particularly enjoyed applying models to the data to extract predicters for covid 19 cases.

**5. Basic array functions** - this assignment was done to show understanding of array based data structures and potential functions that can be used.

**6. Advanced array functions** - this assignment was done to show further understanding of array based data structures and functions

**7. Pandemic simulation** - Development of functions used in a pandemic simulation that displays the potential of disease to spread. 

**8. skip lists** - data structure exploration where a variety of functions were developed to show understanding of how skip lists work and can be utilised in data analysis

**9. Tweets predictive model** - through this project i was able to use jave to create a model and relevant functions that predicts tweet polarity.

**10. Map Reduce** - Implementation of Multiple Map Reduce models to efficiently handle big data 

**11. RTree** - Implementation of an RTree for big data
